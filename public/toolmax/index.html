        Above is a snippet of gameplay from Toolmax,
        the mobile game I created in high school (2019).
        <br><br>
        I created the game with Xcode, Swift, and SpriteKit.
        Everything else was created entirely from scratch:
        the illustration, animation, colors, etc. 
        Toolmax was largley a creative project â€” it allowed
        me to combine my creative and technical skills.
